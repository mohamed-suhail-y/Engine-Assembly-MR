# Engine-Assembly-MR

## Overview
Engine Assembly is a Mixed Reality (MR) based simulation specifically designed for hand tracking in a real-time environment. This simulation focuses on the assembly of a V8 engine, providing an immersive and interactive experience for users. This basically trains the people about the assembling of the parts of the engine.

## Features
- **Hand Tracking:** Utilizes advanced hand tracking technology to provide a natural and intuitive interaction with the simulation.
- **Real-Time Environment:** Offers a realistic and responsive environment for a lifelike experience.
- **V8 Engine Assembly:** Focused on the detailed and precise assembly of a V8 engine, catering to educational and training purposes.

## Installation
1. **System Requirements:**
   - VR Headset (e.g., Oculus 3)
   - Hand Tracking Device (e.g., Leap Motion, Oculus Quest Hand Tracking)
   - Compatible PC with VR-ready specifications

2. **Software Requirements:**
   - Unity 3D or Unreal Engine (depending on the development platform used)
   - Relevant SDKs and drivers for VR headset and hand tracking device

3. **Steps:**
   - Clone or download the repository from [Repository Link].
   - Open the project in the selected development platform (Unity or Unreal Engine).
   - Ensure all SDKs and drivers are correctly installed and configured.
   - Build and deploy the project to your VR setup.

## Usage
1. **Setup:**
   - Ensure your VR headset and hand tracking device are properly connected and configured.
   - Launch the simulation application.

2. **Controls:**
   - Use hand gestures as per the hand tracking guidelines provided within the simulation to interact with the V8 engine parts.
   - Follow on-screen prompts and instructions for assembling the engine.

3. **Assembly Process:**
   - The simulation guides you step-by-step through the assembly of a V8 engine.
   - Each part of the engine can be interacted with using your hands, providing a hands-on learning experience.
